<div class="section">
  <h2>What is the Care System?</h2>
  <p>
    The care system is a network of services designed to provide support, protection, and a safe environment for children and young people who cannot live with their birth families. This includes foster care, residential homes, and kinship care. Its goal should be to ensure every child in care receives love, stability, and the opportunity to thrive.

<div class="section">
  <h2>How I Want to Improve It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide trauma-informed training for all carers and staff</li>
    <li>Implement stronger accountability and oversight of care providers</li>
    <li>Ensure access to mental health support from day one</li>
    <li>Put care-experienced voices at the centre of reform decisions</li>
    <li>Reduce unnecessary placement moves and prioritise stability</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    The system has been broken for too long. Too many of us have stories of being mistreated, unheard, or forgotten. My journey through care made me who I am, but it should not take pain to create purpose. I believe in a care system that actually cares — one built on respect, healing, and hope. This isn’t just about policies. It’s about people. And I will never stop fighting to make it better.
